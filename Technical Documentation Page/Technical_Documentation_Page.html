        <p>This site is designed to inform about the types of dinosaurs on Isla Nublar</p>
        <li>There are several ways in which we classify our dinosaurs.</li>

        <p>There are two main types of dinosaurs on the island:</p>
        <li>Carnivores (Meat Eaters)</li>
        <li>Herbivores (Plant Eaters)</li>
        <p>We will also show a few of the parks newest additions:</p>
        <li>Hybrids </li>

        <p>These Predators eat meat and are the most dangerous to work with.</p>
        <p>The three most notable are:</p>
        <li>T-rex (A strong, sharp toothed, and fast predator)</li>
        <li>Spinosaurus (A massive creature with a long spine on its back)</li>
        <li>Raptors (Fast, agile, and cunning predators that work together in teams)</li>

      <article>
        <p>These creatures eat plants. Though they don't eat meat they are still very dangerous if one is not careful near them.</p>
        <p>The three most notable are:</p>
        <li>Stegosaurus (An animal with that has plates on its back and spikes on its tail used for defence.)</li>
        <li>Triceratops (a bull with a frilled head that has 3 massive horns on it)</li>
        <li>Brachiosaurus (One of the tallest dinosaurs to roam the earth)</li>

        <p>Theorectically all dinosaurs are hybrids in the park, but those in this group are the ones that have been created and are entirely new.</p>
        <p>A hybrid's DNA is a collection of different creatures that have been spliced into one.</p>
        <p>The five most notable are:</p>
        <!--Hybrid 1-->
        <li>Indomious Rex (Similar to the T-rex, but with more teeth and speed)</li>
          <code>DNA: 
            Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, Carnotaurus, Giganotosaurus, Majungasaurus, Rugops, and Therizinosaurus,
            as well as modern animals like cuttlefish, tree frogs, and a pit viper snake.
          </code>
         <!--Hybrid 2-->
        <li>Indo Raptor (A newer version of indominous that is smaller and more useable in war than the Indominous Rex)</li>
          <code> DNA: 
            Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor (A much bigger portion of the creature's DNA is based on this dinosaur), 
            Carnotaurus, Giganotosaurus, Majungasaurus, Rugops, and Therizinosaurus, [something with opposable thumbs added as well],
            as well as the modern animal: tree frogs. [The cuttlefish and viper seem to be removed]
          </code>   
         <!--Hybrid 3-->
        <li>Paradeinonychus (an amphibious, high-speed hunter)</li>
          <code> DNA: 
            Parasaurolophus, Deinonychus, as well as the modern animal: tree frogs.
          </code>
         <!--Hybrid 4-->
        <li>Velocirapteryx (bred for mobility and ferocity)</li>
          <code> DNA: 
           Velociraptor, Archaeopteryx, as well as the modern animal: tree frogs.
          </code>
         <!--Hybrid 5-->
        <li>Amargospinus (a ferocious carnivore with the size of a Brachiosaurus)</li>
          <code> DNA: 
            Amargasaurus, Spinosaurus, as well as the modern animal: tree frogs.
